This is a replacement for `flymake-create-temp-inplace'. The
difference is that it gives a file name in
`temporary-file-directory' instead of the same directory as
FILE-NAME.

For the use of PREFIX see that function.

Note that not making the temporary file in another directory
\(like here) will not if the file you are checking depends on
relative paths to other files \(for the type of checks flymake
makes)."
